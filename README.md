# Cryptocurrencies
Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies


## Overview
The investment bank, Accountability Accounting, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio to its clients. The management needs assistance in determining which cryptocurrencies should be offered.  So they requested a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and if they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The data getting from the company needed to be cleaned in order to fit the machine learning models, and because there isn't a known output, unsupervised machine learning was used.

For grouping the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm was used and the data was visualized so the result could be shared with the management of the company.
